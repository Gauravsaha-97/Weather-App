# Weather-App

Weather App is a live weather tracking web application which takes the current latitude and longitude of the user once the user turns on the location on their devices. Using this data, the application makes a GET request to the OpenWeather API and get the location, weather summary and the temperature at that particular user location. The temperature what we get from the API is in Kelvin, so we converted it to Celsius. By clicking on the temperature unit ("C" or "F") in the web page, the Celsius data is converted to Fahrenheit and is displayed, and vice-versa.
